# Table booking system for a small restaurant

A recently opened restaurant don't have staff to take bookings over the phone due to sudden popularity. They’re scrambling to put something into production that supports this. They’ve asked a consultancy, which you are part of, to create a prototype booking system. Your task is the backend part of the prototype. Assume that the frontend is being handled by your colleague. There’s *no need to implement* the server boilerplate for this exercise.

## Tips

- Ask clarifying questions.
- Keep it simple, assume this iteration is the MVP, but one intended to work in production for a short time, as a proof of concept for a limited number of customers.
- Mention any scope or user scenarios considered, but excluded.
- Consider the unhappy path (e.g. where can exceptions or failures occur)
- UI is not a concern.
- Write good tests

## MVP

- Support booking a seat for a single day that restaurant staff can use.
- Restaurant can seat 30 people.
