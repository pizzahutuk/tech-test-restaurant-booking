# Restaurant Booking System

A restaurant owner has asked you to implement a booking system for their restaurant. Please implement the following requirements one by one.

## Guidance

* Keep it Simple.
    * Do not create API endpoints
    * Do not use a real database. ( Hardcoded Javascipt Objects/Arrays is fine)
    * Use simple functions and/or classes.
* Write Tests as you go.

## Requirements

1. A Customer should be able to book a seat.

2. The Restaurant has a limited capacity and only has space for 30 seats.

3. The Owner can see the amount of free seats available.

4. The Owner can see the seat number of the next available seat.

5. The Customer should be able to book a Table rather than individual Seats. Each Table has 2 Seats.
