# Table booking system for a small restaurant

A recently opened restaurant realised that their customers prefer to book tables online. They’re scrambling to put something into production that supports this. They’ve asked two engineers to create this booking system, and your task is the BE part of it. Assume that the frontend part is someone else’s concern and that you’ll be using serverless cloud hosting: there’s *no need to worry* about the server component, only the business logic.

## Tips

- Keep it simple, assume this iteration is the MVP, but one intended to work in production for a short time, as a proof of concept for a limited number of customers.
- Mention any scope or user scenarios considered, but excluded.
- Consider the unhappy path (e.g. where can exceptions or failures occur)
- UI is not a concern.
- Write good tests

## MVP

- Support booking a seat.
- Restaurant can seat 30 people.
